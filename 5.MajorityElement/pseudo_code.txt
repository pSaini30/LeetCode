hasmap to store element & occurance

return element whole value > size/2;


time complezxity: O(n)


-----------------

2nd approch will be
 sort array 
 return elemt at n/2

 as the element should appear more than n/2 so it will be at n/2 position
  but complexity will be O(n log n) as its the sort complexity
